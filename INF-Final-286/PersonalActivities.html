                    <p>My favorite activity to do in my free time is go fishing.  Every year my family goes to Florida and deep sea fishing.  We also got bass and catfish fishing a lot in the summer.  My favorite type of fishing is crappie fishing.  They are the most fun to catch and are quite delicious no matter how you cook them.</p>

                    <h4>Magic The Gathering</h4>
                    <p>Magic The Gathering is a hobby i picked up in the past few months.  It is a card game requiring at leat 2 players and can play with up to 8.  The format I play is called commander and is typically played with a pod of four players.  In commander you have a starting deck of 100 cards with one legendary creature set aside as your "commander".  Your goal is to get all of the other players life totals to 0 before yours does.</p>
